Explanation:
	Streamlined some of my scheduling updating functions from homework 2. I created the unlock and lock functions , and then I used them appropriately across the functions accessing sensitive variables. Implemented the thread_join and then did some substantial debugging, as I had some nuances because of my static thread varibles (lot of seg faults from going out side bounds). Realized my first implementation was passing most of the tests but was not functioing according to definition. So I then overhauled my first implementation. With that done, then just added the semaphore functions and variables.
